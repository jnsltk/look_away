Simple 20-20-20 rule timer app for the terminal written in go.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jnsltk/look_away.git && cd look_away
go install ./cmd/look_away
```

Make sure that the Go bin directory ($GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin) is in your system’s PATH. You can check if it’s included by running:

```sh
echo $PATH
```

If it's not in your path, add it to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```sh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

```sh
look_away
```

To get help use:

```sh
look_away --help
```

## Config

The tool can be configured using a yaml file. The default config is created on first run, and looks like this:

```yaml
timer:
    duration_minutes: 20
    break_seconds: 20
notifications:
    use_alert: false
```

To find your default config location type:

```sh
look_away --config-path
```

Tested only on Mac and Linux.
